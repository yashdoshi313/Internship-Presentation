## üìå Projects

### **Project 1 ‚Äì Purchase Forecasting for Tiger of Sweden**
- **Problem**: Lack of clear visibility into purchasing patterns, requiring reliable monthly forecasts to support Q2 2025 cash flow planning.  
- **Approach**:
  - Extracted raw invoice data from Visual ERP (`TOS_Stmt.csv`, Nov 2019‚ÄìFeb 2025).  
  - Cleaned and pre-processed data in Excel & Python (Pandas, Statsmodels-ARIMA).  
  - Analyzed historical purchase trends and built ARIMA forecasting models.  
- **Insights**:
  - September = peak spend; May & December = low spend.  
  - 86% invoices paid; 14% unpaid flagged as credit risk.  
  - Forecast: Baseline reserve ‚Ç¨528K for Q2 2025, with flexibility up to ‚Ç¨1.45M.

### **Project 2 ‚Äì Sales Return Audit for a Major Client**
- **Problem**: High return rates eroding margins; no visibility into return-heavy SKUs and regions.  
- **Approach**:
  - Cleaned Visual ERP datasets (Python + Excel), merged transaction & overview tables.  
  - Designed **Power BI dashboard** with star schema (FactReturns + DimProduct/Store/Date/Division).  
  - DAX calculations for top returned SKUs and regional analysis.  
- **Insights**:
  - Top Returned Product: *Mix & Match Trouser* (fit/quality issues).  
  - High Return Stores: Vancouver Store (366) & Yorkdale Store (311).  
  - Seasonal Trend: Q4 spikes (Oct‚ÄìNov) linked to fall collection & promos.  
  - Ontario & BC drove ~70‚Äì80% of return dollars.  
- **Recommendations**: Audit sizing/quality, improve size guides, refine promo return policies.

### **Project 3 ‚Äì Export & Duty Audit**
- **Problem**: No centralized visibility on export duties, invoice duplication, and brand-level efficiency.  
- **Approach**:
  - Merged brand-level export tables in **SQL Server Management Studio**.  
  - Analyzed monthly duties, per-unit brand costs, and duplicate invoices.  
- **Insights**:
  - December 2024 = highest duty payments (year-end surge).  
  - **Tiger Brand** had highest duty per unit (‚Ç¨18.16 vs. ‚Ç¨10‚Äì12 for others).  
  - Duplicate invoices (e.g., SI-1054410 repeated 7x) posed audit risks.  
- **Recommendations**: Duty structure review, tariff optimization, enforce invoice uniqueness rules.

### **Project 4 ‚Äì Account Reconciliation (Dec 2024 ‚Äì Mar 2025)**
- **Problem**: Reconciliation with a major client (cannot name) during creditor protection filing.  
- **Approach**:
  - Extracted invoice/credit/payment data from Visual ERP & client‚Äôs 852 statement.  
  - Created pivot tables to detect anomalies at store/transaction-date level.  
  - Pinpointed discrepancies (e.g., Yorkdale store 29/01/25, $130.96 misreport).  
- **Outcome**: Delivered accurate reconciliation, minimizing financial exposure and ensuring reporting compliance.
